When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

That's convenient when I want to access the project from other computers, to share it or to colaborate with people non-locally.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So that I can choose exactly what I want to be pulled. There are a lot of changes that might not
be final.
