//
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

That's convenient when I want to access the project from other computers, to share it or to colaborate with people non-locally.
//
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So that I can choose exactly what I want to be pulled. There are a lot of changes that might not
be final.
//
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is similar to a clone of another respository on Github, but it is made in a way that there's a record
of where it came from. It's useful to allow programmers to make changes to previous repositories without
changing the original and while giving credit to the original repository owner.

Clones are copies of the git repository and branches. Useful get a copy of a github repository to a
local  machine or to just share to respository with someone else in a simple way.

Branches are paralel "timelines" of the code that can then be merged. Useful for experiments or
different versions of the program.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It helps the user to know how the different version aren't in sync.
