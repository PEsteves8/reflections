//
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A folder called .git gets created. The info with the changes in each commit will
be stored there (I think).
//
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area includes the files that will be part of a commit. It allows the user
to just commit the files that actually matter. Files that never change don't have to be
there.
