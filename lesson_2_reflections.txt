//
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A folder called .git gets created. The info with the changes in each commit will
be stored there (I think).
//
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area includes the files that will be part of a commit. It allows the user
to just commit the files that actually matter. Files that never change don't have to be
there.
//
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can use the staging area to make sure that I only commit what I want. I can choose
to just commit whatever is related to a specific logical change.
//
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?

Situtations in which the programmer wants to change the code drastically to try a different approach
or a whole different version of the program. Branches allow you to save a backup
or the original version before branching.
//
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagrams show the different branches allowing the programmer to easily see
the different branches of the project.
//
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

The new code from each branch will be added, according to the differences between
the branches and their original common code. A new commit gets created with the
code from both branches.
